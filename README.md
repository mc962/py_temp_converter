This is a temperature converter application that allows the user to convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, as well as Kelvin. It allows a user to enter the temperature to calculate, and then select the units to convert from and convert into.

The application also has the ability to handle potential errors, spawning a message box telling the user what the current issue is, so that it can be fixed.

Finally, the application has the ability to round the result to either 5 decimal places, or no decimal places. For an everyday user that just wants a quick conversion, no decimal places is likely the best option. However, for a user that may want a more accurate value, such as for a scientific calculation, 5 decimal places are given in order to allow the user to maintain a certain amount of accuracy in temperature calculations.
